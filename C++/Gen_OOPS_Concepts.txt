1. What is OOP
	It is a technique to develop logical modules such as classes, that contain properties, methods, fields and events.
	It is an approach to build modular software systems. The OOP system integrates code and data into an "object". 
	It is an improvement over structured programming. It divides the system into modular objects which own their data 
	   and are responsible for their own behavior. This feature is known as encapsulation. 
	Concepts in OOPS:
	Abstraction: It defines the essential characteristics of an object that distinguishes it from other kind of objects.
	Encapsulation: Makes the object to have its own state and behavior. For example, "sqaure root" can be an object of 
	   Math. Encapsulation enables this object to have not only its own function, but also its own data.
	Inheritance: It defines the relationship between the classes where in one class shares the structure or behavior
	   defined in another class. This is called singleton inheritance. If the class shares properties between multiple
	   classes, then it is called multiple inheritance. 

2. What is an object
	Object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. An object has a state (data) and behavior (code). 
	They correspond to real world things. For ex, a graphics program will have objects like circle, square etc.
	A shopping system will have objects like shopping cart, customer, product. They are instances of classes.
