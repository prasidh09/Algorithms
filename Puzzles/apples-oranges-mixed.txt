Objective:
==========
	We have three covered baskets "Apples", "Oranges" and "Mixed". They are labelled incorrectly. Choosing only one fruit
	from one of the packets, how can you determine how to relabel the packets.

Logic:
======
	Always pick from the basket named "Mixed". 
		If the picked fruit is "Apple", then the mixed is actually the apple basket. This is because the baskets
		are labelled incorrectly and we have picked from mixed basket. So the label is correct, which means it is
		an apple basked. The box named "Orange" is mixed because, it cannot be an "Apple" basket. 
		
		If the picked fruit is "Orange", then the basket is actually "Orange" basket. Since the boxes are labelled
		incorrectly, there cannot be an orange fruit in the mixed basket unless it is an orange basked. The basket
		named "Apple" is "Mixed" and the box named "Orange" is mixed
