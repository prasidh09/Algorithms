Objective:
==========
	We have a gold bar with seven segments. For seven days we must pay an employe with one gold segment each day. 
	Breaking the bar only twice, how can you ensure the employee gets paid appropriately.

Logic:
======
	Break the bar twice such that we have 1 == 2-3 == 4-5-6-7
	Day 1: Give the 1st segmet. We have 2-3 == 4-5-6-7
	Day 2: Give 2-3 segment and get back the 1. We have 1 == 4-5-6-7
	Day 3: Give the 1st segment. We have 4-5-6-7
	Day 4: Give the 4-5-6-7 segment and get back 1 and 2-3. We have 1 == 2-3
	Day 5: Give the 1st segment. We have 2-3
	Day 6: Give the 2-3 segment and get back 1. We have 1
	Day 7: Give the 1st segment and finish it off
