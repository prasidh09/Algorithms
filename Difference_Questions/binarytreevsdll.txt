Objective:
==========
	Difference between binary tree and a doubly linked list.

Logic:
======
	Structurally, they both are same. It differs based on how we use the pointers. 
	In a doubly linked list, a node can have atmost two pointers to it. i.e previous's next and next's previous.
	This is not possible in a binary. It can have atmost one pointer to it. 

	Traversal times can be greatly reduced in a binary tree in average case. To reach the leaf node, it only takes 
	log n time. 
	In DLL, there is no log n traversal unless the list is sorted (using binary search)
