Difference between macros and function

1. Macros are Pre-processed. It is useful when small code appears many times. Macros do not check for compilation errors. 
   It is faster and no function calling overheads. It expands the size of executable.

2. Functions are run time methods. It is processed by the compiler. Inline functions are only a request to the compiler
   which can be ignored. Normal functions have run time overheads like pushing arguments in the stack
