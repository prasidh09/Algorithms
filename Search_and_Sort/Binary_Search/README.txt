Objective:
==========
	Perform binary search recursively as well as iteratively.

Logic:
======
	If there is anything special, then it is the iterative version. 
	The loop runs till the low value is greater than high. Everything is same, except that there is no
		recursion. The low and high values are modified in the while loop depending on the value of
		the array at mid position.
